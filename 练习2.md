Scholars of happiness have found that close relationships are one of the critical **ingredients** of a contented life. What is true in general is also true of the workplace, according to research by Gallup.（友谊在生活中很重要，在职场中也很重要）

The **pollster** finds that having a “best friend at work” is closely associated with all manner of good things, from greater employee engagement to higher **retention** and better safety records.







At some level, that is unremarkable. Spending time with people you like makes most things more appealing, including work. If a job is sufficiently **humdrum**, **camaraderie** among colleagues can be the main draw. The support of friends can also encourage people to try new things.（列举友谊在工作中的三个好处）



A study from 2015 by Erica Field of Duke University, and her co-authors, looked at the impact of business training given to Indian women. Women who attended the course with a friend were more likely to end up **taking out loans** than those who came alone.（举例：印度女性）

The reverse also applies. Antagonistic relationships with co-workers are always likely to make working life miserable. A study conducted by Valerie Good of Grand Valley State University found that loneliness has an adverse effect on the performance of salespeople.（举例：反例 敌对关系、孤单）

Among other things, they start spending more on wining and dining their customers. The only thing worse than a salesperson who sees you as a way to make money is one who wants your company.（没有同事友谊将会与客户建立友谊）

So friends matter. The problems come when managers see the words “higher employee engagement” and leap to the conclusion that they should try to **engineer（动词 设计）** work friendships.（上司设计友谊未必是一件好事）

In a report published last year Gallup gave the example of an unnamed organisation which has a weekly **companywide** meeting that spotlights one employee’s best friend at work. It’s not known if, in the Q&A, others pop up to sob: “But I thought we were best friends at work.”（一家公司每周讨论最好的朋友）

**Startups** also offer services to encourage work friendships. One monitors the depth of connections between people in different teams. It identifies shared interests (gluten-free baking, say, or workplace surveillance) between employees who don’t know each other and arranges meetings between them. You thought life was bad? At least you are not making **crumpets** with a stranger in finance.（一家公司通过监控来设计友谊）

It is a mistake for managers to **wade into** the business of friend-making, and not just because it royally misses the point. The defining characteristic of friendship is that it is voluntary. Employees are adults; they don’t need their managers to arrange play-dates. And the workplace throws people together, often under testing conditions: friendships will naturally follow.（不应该涉足的原因：1.友谊是自愿的 2.自然而然形成的）

Companies should facilitate interactions between employees, particularly in a world of hybrid and remote working. Social gatherings and buddy systems are reasonable ways to encourage colleagues to meet each other and to foster a culture. But a high-quality work relationship does not require friendship.（但也提出了会对友谊培养有好处的方式）

It requires respect for each other’s **competence（能力）**, a level of trust and a desire to reach the same goal; it doesn’t need birthday cards and a shared interest in **quiltmaking（缝纫技艺）**. Firms should do what they can to encourage these kinds of relationships. If individuals want to take it further, it’s entirely up to them.（公司需要做的：鼓励）
