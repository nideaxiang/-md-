Mount *Erebus*—named after one of the **primordial（原始的）** beings in Greek mythology, son of Chaos, personification of darkness—is the **southernmost（最南端的）** active volcano in the world. More people have been to space than have travelled to Antarctica and set foot on Mount Erebus (pictured).

（Erebus火山名字由来以及极少人曾到过此地）

That is for good reason（指的是很少有人涉足的原因）. When humans first climbed it in the early 1900s, the journey involved violent winds, occasional **frostbite** and bowls of “hoosh” (a potent, greasy combination of boiled, **dehydrated（脱水的）** beef and fat, which would not go bad).

Clive Oppenheimer, a professor of volcanology at Cambridge University, has spent 13 seasons—cumulatively an entire year of his life—living near the summit of Mount Erebus.

In “Mountains of Fire” he r**egale**s readers with gripping stories of his travels, as well as those of adventurers past. He does not just describe what the volcanoes look like, but how they feel and what they mean to the people who encounter them.

A volcano is **a rupture in the crust** of a planet. Through that opening, molten rock and hot gases escape. This can be a sudden and thunderous puff of ash and steam, or it can be a **protracted** **ooze** of **lava**, **razing** everything in its path. Perhaps because of volcanoes’ danger, their longevity and importance are often overlooked.（译：这会是突然的剧烈的灰尘和蒸汽的喷射，或是持久的岩浆流出，摧毁沿途的一切。可能由于火山的危险，它们的寿命和重要性常常被忽视）





But they live hundreds of thousands of years, and the gases they release come from the inside of the Earth. They are probably the very gases that created Earth’s atmosphere billions of years ago. Volcanoes “made the world fit for human purpose”, Dr Oppenheimer writes.（火山的重要性：在数十万年的气体释放中形成为人类所能居住的环境的大气层）

In total he has visited more than a hundred different volcanoes. Few people have come into contact with as many **fiery** mountains as Dr Oppenheimer has. Yet millions live close to them: around 800m（八亿） people have their home within 100km of an active volcano. For some of the more than 1m **Javanese** who have settled in the shadow of Merapi, a volcano in Indonesia, it is a kingdom of ghosts, where the physical and spirit world merge.

A gatekeeper is charged with maintaining the volcano’s “equilibrium” through daily observances and annual ceremonies(译：一位守门人负责维持火山的平衡 通过每日的观察和每年的庆典). In 2010, even after **ominous（有预兆的）** earthquakes and belching gas, the gatekeeper at the time refused to leave his post. He was found afterwards, his body **scorched（烧焦）** in the position of prayer.（爪哇的火山守门人在爆发时拒绝离开，以祈祷的姿势被烧焦）

Both awful and awesome, volcanoes have much more to offer than dramatic geological events, which Dr Oppenheimer documented in his previous book, “Eruptions that Shook the World”. “Mountains of Fire” is a love letter to volcanoes and an investigation into all the ways that they have and continue to sustain humanity—spiritually and scientifically.

Volcanic regions are **hotbeds of biodiversity（生物多样性的温床）**. The lava islands of the Galapagos are textbook examples of evolution in action. Volcanic eruptions can act as a reset button; as lava hardens and begins to erode over the course of years or centuries, the released nutrients and minerals create rich soil.（火山的重要性：生物多样性的温床）

Some of the world’s most productive regions for farming, such as in Indonesia and Central America, owe their abundance to eruptions past. Volcanoes can also help build up underground **aquifers(地下蓄水层)**. For example, without the Tibesti and its five volcanoes in the north of Chad and in southern Libya, the eastern Sahara would be even more **arid**.（火山重要性：创造地下畜水层）

Science still has a lot to learn from the tiny organisms that live in and near volcanoes, in the harshest environments, such as the hot-acid **crater lake（火山湖）** of Ijen on Java. Some might one day find a use for these micro-organisms in medicine or air purification.（火山重要性：火山微生物的潜在价值）

Volcanoes also produce **geothermal**（地热） energy, which accounts for （占比）significant shares（很大份额） of electricity supply in a growing number of countries, including El Salvador, Kenya and New Zealand.（火山重要性：火山地热能在越来越多的国家电力供应中占比很大）

The most common type of volcanic rock, **basalt（玄武岩）**, is capable of permanently trapping carbon dioxide, making volcanoes an important player in the game of carbon capture and storage. Long viewed as a fearsome enemy of civilisation, volcanoes may yet become a **saviour（救世主）.**
